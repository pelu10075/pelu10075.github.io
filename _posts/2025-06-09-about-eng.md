This blog was created out of a deep interest in computer programming and aims to document and share my academic journey and exploration of areas I am passionate about. Through this space, I intend to systematically organize my learning process and reflections on various STEM topics.

The blog will primarily focus on the following subjects:

Linear Algebra

Calculus

Probability and Statistics

Graph Theory

Algorithms

Programming Languages

While the blog will be written mainly in Korean, documents will be categorized by language using the tag `EN` for English posts.

Although I am still in the process of learning, I strive to deepen my understanding of these fields through consistent study and reflection. I hope this blog becomes a meaningful space for exchanging knowledge and insights with others who share similar interests.

Thank you.
